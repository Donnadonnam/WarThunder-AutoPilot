# [![WTLOGO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealcyber71/WarThunder-AutoPilot/main/autopilot/img/war_thunder_logo-removebg-preview.png) WarThunder-AutoPilot
An experiment to control fighter jets/bombers, programmatically in War Thunder

## About
This is an experiment of mine where I use some Desktop automation libraries to automate WarThunder, I also plan on expanding the project into making my own controller for war thunder, adding voice commands and maybe even building real life drones that are automated!
**Note:** This is NOT a cheat, this is simply an experiment for research and educational purposes.

## Explaination
I've divided the project into 3 parts mainly:
- [x] Takeoff automatically
- [x] Aim and shoot at arial targets
- [ ] Land automatically

Some other goals to achieve:
* Detect targets and bomb them
* Add voice commands
* Build a custom controller
* Apply the same principles to irl drones and UAVs

## Demonstration

I've demonstrated each part in these videos here: 

[![Part - 1 | Takeoff](https://img.youtube.com/vi/GHQWqg86qcc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHQWqg86qcc) 

[![Part - 2 | Auto Aim](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZvO-6kXUpfM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvO-6kXUpfM)

Part -3 is in the making!
